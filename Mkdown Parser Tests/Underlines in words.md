Title:  Underlines in words

Seq:    9.1

Code:

I'm documenting the internals of software. Object names often include underscore characters, e.g., "name_of_the_thing."

I'm running into trouble with the way that Notenik applies markdown formatting.

For this string: "See kd_Settings > MainGroup_Access." 

It formats as "See kd*Settings > MainGroup*Access."
