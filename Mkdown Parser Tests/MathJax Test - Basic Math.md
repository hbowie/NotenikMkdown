Title:  MathJax Test - Basic Math

Seq:    251

Code: 

Basic math
----------

Whenever you typeset mathematical notation, it needs to have “Math” style. For
example: If $a$ is an integer, then $2a+1$ is odd.

Superscripts and subscripts are created using the characters `^` and `_`,
respectively: $x^2+y^2=1$ and $a_n=0$. It is fine to have both on a single
letter: $x_0^2$.

If the superscript [or subscript] is more than a single character, enclose the
superscript in curly braces: $e^{-x}$.

Greek letters are typed using commands such as `\gamma` ($\gamma)$ and `\Gamma`
($\Gamma$).

Named mathematics operators are usually typeset in roman. Most of the standards
are already available. Some examples: $\det A$, $\cos\pi$, and $\log(1-x)$.
