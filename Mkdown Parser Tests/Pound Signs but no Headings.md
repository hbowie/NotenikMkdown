The following lines should be interpreted as headings. 

# 1 no pets, 20 amp electrical, can park trailer there.   
# 2 pets OK.  $20 pet fee
# 2023-09-06 Something important happens

And what happens now?

This is an ordinary paragraph.  
This is a second sentence. 
# This is a heading with no preceding blank line. 

#This is a level 1 heading with no space after the hash marks. 

##This is a level 2 heading with no space after the hash marks. 

#7 is a good bet for this race. 

And this is just another paragraph.
