Body:

Dear Herb,

Would you be good enough to check whether *MathJax* support is still functioning? I have checked Collection Settings in an existing Collection and quit and opened *Notenik* several times and *MathJax* is enabled. The code below does not display correctly in my Collection.

Inline expression ${e}^{i\pi}+1=0$

Individual expression:

$${x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$$

Thank you.

Kevin.
