Let's see what happens with a file link: file:///Users/hbowie/Desktop/

And now let's put one within angle brackets: <file:///Users/hbowie/Xcode/NotenikMkdown/LICENSE.md>.

And now an inline link: [License file](file:///Users/hbowie/Xcode/NotenikMkdown/LICENSE.md).

And now a reference link: [License file][license].

[license]: file:///Users/hbowie/Xcode/NotenikMkdown/LICENSE.md
